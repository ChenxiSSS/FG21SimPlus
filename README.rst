Foreground Simulation Suite Plus for the 21 cm Reionization Signal Detection
=============================================================

The FG21simP_ is a simulation suite in the radio domain aiming to offer a 
vivid modeling of the various  foregrounds for the 21 cm signal detection.
This is the next-gen version of our FG21sim_ low frequency radio simulator.
We build the FG21simP_ to generate a full sky simulation map for radio 
facilities like BINGO, MWA, and SKA. 

Key Features
--------
* Supported foreground components:

  + ``galactic/synchrotron``:
    Galactic synchrotron emission
    (*Note:* Only the *polarized* part is considered.)
  + ``galactic/freefree``:
    Galactic free-free emission
    (*Note:* **Update** Need to update the newest version to reflect Lian et al. 2020 papers.)
  + ``galactic/snr``:
    Emission from Galactic supernovae remnants (SNRs)
    (*Note:* Need to check the reference and get an update.)
  + ``extragalactic/discretesource``:
    Emission from extragalactic discrete radio sources via AGN actvities and star formation
    (*Note:* **Update** Currently, Chenxi, Yongkai, and Zhenghao are working on this.)
  + ``extragalactic/minihalo``:
    Emission from extragalactic galaxy clusters with a miniture size
    (*Note:* Need an update.)
  + ``extragalactic/relic``:
    Emission from extragalactic galaxy clusters via shock reacceleration
    (*Note:* **Update** Currently, Yongkai is working on this.)
  + ``extragalactic/halo``:
    Emission from extragalactic galaxy clusters via turbulent reacceleration
    (*Note:* **Update** For now, only giant radio halos are considered, the modeling of which is elaborated
    in our paper:
    `2019, ApJ, 879, 104 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab21bc>`_;
