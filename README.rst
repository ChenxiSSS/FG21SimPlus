Realistic Foregrounds Simulation for EoR 21cm Signal Detection
==============================================================

**WARNING:**
This package is still under heavy development, and may lack some
necessary features or even fail to run correctly.
It is *NOT* recommended to use it at the moment!
Nevertheless, *tests and feedback* are always welcome!


This package provides the tools to simulate the *realistic*
low-frequency radio foregrounds, which can be further
used to test various foreground removal or separation methods, for the
purpose of successfully detecting the 21cm cosmological signal arising
from the netrual hydrogen (HI) at epoch of reionization (EoR).
